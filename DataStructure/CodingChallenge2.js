// Coding Challenge #2

// Your tasks:

// 1. Loop over the game.scored array and print each player name to the console,
// along with the goal number (Example: "Goal 1: Lewandowski")
// 2. Use a loop to calculate the average odd and log it to the console (We already
// studied how to calculate averages, you can go check if you don't remember)
// 3. Print the 3 odds to the console, but in a nice formatted way, exactly like this:
//      Odd of victory Bayern Munich: 1.33
//      Odd of draw: 3.25
//      Odd of victory Borrussia Dortmund: 6.5
//  Get the team names directly from the game object, don't hardcode them (except for "draw").
//  Hint: Note how the odds and the game objects have the same property names ï¿½

// 4. Bonus: Create an object called 'scorers' which contains the names of the
// players who scored as properties, and the number of goals as the value. In this
// game, it will look like this:
//  {
//      Gnarby: 1,
//      Hummels: 1,
//      Lewandowski: 2
//  }
